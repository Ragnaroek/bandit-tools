# Bandit Tools

Visualisation/Evaluation App for the *Multi-armed bandit algorithms in Rust* implementation 
over here: https://github.com/Ragnaroek/bandit

# Documentation

The web application can be found here: https://ragnaroek.github.io/bandit-tools/

The bandit algorithm implementation has two files that can be visualised with this tool:

 * state file: contains the counts of arm draws and the average reward for each arm so far
 * log file: contains a detailed log of every selection and update of the bandit

You can upload both files to the webapp and it will visualise and summarize the data in there.
